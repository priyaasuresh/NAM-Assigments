- Extract a social graph of the manually identified characters in the text
- Calculate the four types of centrality of main protagonists i.e. degree, betweenness,
closeness, PageRank 
- Calculate the global clustering coefficient of your graph and local clustering coefficient
of the main protagonist nodes. Detect communities 
- Find the degree distribution, average shortest path, size of the largest component. Create an equivalent generative model to compare against the social graph extracted
- Analysis
